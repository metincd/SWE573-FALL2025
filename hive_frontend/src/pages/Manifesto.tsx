            We've never needed solidarity and each other more.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are living through a period in which individualism, marketization, and commodification have intensified to an unbearable degree.
          </p>

          <p>
            The most fundamental areas of solidarity and mutual aid in our lives—childcare, education, food, care work, elder solidarity, technical assistance, and memory transfers—are increasingly being transformed into "services," or more accurately, commercial products. Historical and social values, such as developing neighborly relationships and producing and consuming together, which are considered fundamental conditions of community, are becoming invisible. As we become alienated from each other and our production in megacities, profit-driven service platforms have fragmented labor, causing us to develop only buyer-seller relationships.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this atmosphere, The HIVE platform represents a digital counterpoint to those who claim that "another form of relationship, another society, another world is possible."
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl font-semibold">
            Time instead of money, solidarity instead of competition, communalism instead of individualism.
          </p>

          <p>
            Economic inequality is increasing, social solidarity networks are weakening, care work is becoming invisible, young people are being pushed into the loneliness of individualism, and the elderly are being isolated from society. Our cultural heritage, experiences, and long-standing knowledge are not being passed on to future generations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Under these circumstances, The HIVE is not just a good idea; it is a manifestation of humanity's efforts to keep the tradition of solidarity alive.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are decommodifying service. Here, we help each other not through payment, but through our time and contact. One hour of service is equivalent to another hour of service. We are breaking the hierarchy created by the market and recognizing everyone's contribution equally.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tutoring the neighborhood children, helping your elderly neighbor with her shopping, teaching young students your traditional recipes… These were "services" that society provided without expecting anything in return. We are bringing these values ​​to light and making them visible again. We are creating a "digital neighborhood" where society is reunited.
          </p>

          <p>
            We are not turning our backs on the experiences of older people, nor allowing their knowledge to be lost. We are building a shared cultural space where experiences, recipes, crafts, memories, and stories can be passed on to younger generations.
          </p>

          <p>
            On service platforms, people are driven to sell to each other in competition. Here, there is no competition, no employer or employee. Here, everyone is an equal, contributing, and contributing member of the community.
          </p>

          <p>
            Loneliness is a significant social problem that many of us feel deeply, yet find no solution to. The HIVE reminds you that you are not alone. It is an initiative in the digital world for a more equal, more solidaristic, and more humane life. Our goal is to put solidarity back at the center of life and to recreate a public space where people can trust each other.
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl font-semibold">
            We want to make the individual, oppressed by the system, a part of society again. We want to liberate knowledge, time, and labor from the market. If you share similar feelings, observations, and needs, you are invited to join us in solidarity with your community. Welcome.
